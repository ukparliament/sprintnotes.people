# Sprint 61 – More research, members issues and summer breaks

Hello, this is [Dia](https://twitter.com/DN78), the product manager working on [beta.parliament.uk](https://beta.parliament.uk/). I lead the People team, and I am responsible for products involving people (MPs, Lords, staff), constituencies, parties and government departments etc. Alan, is holidaying somewhere nice and so this week i will provide an update of the work the members/people team have done and what we learned in the process.

##### The team’s current focus:

> Improve the process of contacting MPs and Lords

> Identifying and understanding the issues on the Member pages/written questions

##### Overview

This will a reduced edition as many of the team were on annual leave during this sprint. Work continued on contact discovery, with the team contacting stakeholders and reviewing research.

##### What we’ve done

Feedback

While we still have been revieiwng more feedback, we now have a priotised backlog of work to be picked up by the development team.
Stakeholders

The first draft of the stakeholder map is complete and we have engagement plan. This was shared with a wider group at our sprint review today.

I have been scheduling in interviews with some members of staff, based in Westminister, to talk to them about contact.

We also took part in the westminister roadshow, where we spoke about the work we are ding to improve the contact process for MPs and Lords.

Existing contact research

[Marttiina](https://twitter.com/marttiinak) has compiled the synthesis of all the research regarding contact and presented to the team and stakeholders at the sprint review.This included going through the themes emerging from the raw data and attempting to visualise it. The next steps in terms of research is to go through all the research as a team and come up with recommendations.

Content

Alan reviewed and revised user needs and iterated contact copy for MP pages. He has also been delivering 'Creating digital content' workshop and has revised CMS training for UK Parliament.

Live Issues

The team has also been busy looking at some issues on the roles pages of Lords on beta.

##### What we have planned

The team will go through all the research that Marttiina has compiled and also the desk research that they did, and come up with a list of findings and recommendations for contact.

The team will also work on some of the issues highlighted in feedback received via the beta website. Some of the things we will be doing are:

* Update the beta banner at the bottom of the Members pages to be more prominent and update wording in order to set expectations better
* Look into creating a page of known issues we can link to in order to better set expectations with users

##### Random things we have learned or have been reading

I have been reading Ayan Rands' Fountain Head, a different perspective, everytime i read it.
