# Sprint 57

Hello, this is [Alan](https://twitter.com/alanmayers), a content designer working on [beta.parliament.uk](https://beta.parliament.uk/). At the end of each sprint I will provide an update of the work the members/people team have done and what we learned in the process.

##### The team’s current focus:

> Make written questions and answers easy to find, easy to comprehend and a trusted source for re-use.

##### Overview

Last sprint felt very productive, with [significant progress made on several fronts]( https://ukparliament.github.io/sprintnotes.people/20/). This sprint, due to wider team commitments (detailed below), inevitably suffered by comparison.

The team still managed to move forward, especially in preparing for our next discovery phase.

##### What we’ve done

Delivery

* prepared for next week’s contact discovery sessions

Design and content

* identified and addressed empty states across roles and question pages

Development

* [implemented new designs]( https://beta.parliament.uk/questions/8xTC7A3G) onto the written question and answer pages
* investigated ways to inform users that a table is scrollable
* identified a bug that hid an MP’s role from a written question page

Analytics

* implemented scroll tracking for roles pages
* defined measures of success for written question and answers
* placed a Hotjar survey on [MP and Lords roles pages]( https://beta.parliament.uk/people/cpIYUtpa/associations)
* used a technical workaround to find out why people are getting error pages when using the postcode search on MP and Lords pages

Research

* reviewed of user needs from documents related to MP and Lords work
* formulated research plan for contact discovery

##### Wider team work

Analytics

* updated the [cookies policy on UK Parliament website]( https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/privacy/) to allow us to collect data through Application Insights

Content

* delivered CMS training sessions to colleagues across parliament
* participated in a weeklong series of workshops on content modelling for beta

Design

* looked at repurposing existing filter pattern to filter members’ roles by type

##### Even wider team work

[Victor](https://twitter.com/_victorhwang) and [Marttiina](https://twitter.com/marttiinak) travelled to Newcastle for GDS Service Design training, which will immediately benefit the team during our upcoming contact work.

[Victor](https://twitter.com/_victorhwang) contributed to a workshop at the PDS hosted [International Design in Government Conference]( http://international.gov-design.com/), including people from Canada, Australia and Taiwan – it was a relief to find we all face similar challenges.

Naz facilitated a session about analysts and data science at a cross-government performance analyst conference.

##### What we have planned

* discovery sessions for contact journeys
* access all questions from the beta homepage
* access written question and answer lists from each question and answer page
* investigate the status of pagination across beta

##### Departures

[Bryony](https://twitter.com/bryonywatson1) left. The team have been inconsolable. They marked the occasion in the only way they knew how: karaoke!
