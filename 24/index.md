# Sprint 60 – desk research and more summer breaks, vol. 2

Hello, this is [Alan](https://twitter.com/alanmayers), a content designer working on [beta.parliament.uk](https://beta.parliament.uk/). At the end of each sprint I will provide an update of the work the members/people team have done and what we learned in the process.

##### The team’s current focus:

> Improve the process of contacting MPs and Lords

##### Overview

This will a reduced edition as many of the team were on annual leave during this sprint, myself included. Work continued on contact discovery, with the team contacting stakeholders and reviewing research.

##### What we’ve done

Feedback

We have noticed an increase in the feedback we are receiving via the beta website. There have been lots of useful issues raised and suggestions made, including:

* having [All-Party Parliamentary Group]( https://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/members/apg/) membership on roles pages
* providing biographical information on members’ pages
* modify the [‘Find your MP’]( https://beta.parliament.uk/mps) tool to allow searching by name, as well as postcode

Dia and Simon are meeting regularly to assess the feedback and convert it into items to add to the backlog for prioritisation.

Stakeholders

Simon continued to develop our stakeholder map. He is also working on an accompanying engagement plan to coordinate research interviews and inform stakeholders of our progress.

Dia has continued to meet with colleagues from enquiries teams within the [House of Commons](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/commons/hcio/about-our-service/) and [House of Lords](https://www.parliament.uk/business/lords/get-involved-with-the-lords/house-of-lords-external-communications/). The information received is helping the team understand why people contact the Houses.

The majority of enquiries for both House of Commons and Lords include:

* questions about the Houses, their work and members
* procedure
* access to record or documents
* information on who to contact elsewhere (e.g. government departments)

The House of Commons also receive a significant number of enquiries about local or national issues and personal matters. People also contact the House of Lords to ask about their members’ work and areas of interest.

Existing contact research

[Marttiina](https://twitter.com/marttiinak) continues to work her way through the research archives. She is collecting observations and findings related to contacting MPs and Lords.

Marttiina is also working to prepare the data collected by labelling the findings. This will make it easier for us to sift through it as a team, which we plan to later in the discovery process.

Members’ roles

Naz has created a Google Analytics dashboard based on our ‘measures of success’ (i.e. usage and user satisfaction) for the [roles pages](https://beta.parliament.uk/people/43RHonMf/associations).

He also worked toward fixing our Google Optimise tag, which is needed for A/B testing. This took him longer than expected due to our Google Analytics set up and amount of sub domains we have, but the issue has now been resolved.

The next steps will be to review the changes and begin testing.

There’s one more update from him: he was promoted to Performance Analyst (from an Associate role). Congratulations, Naz!

##### What we have planned

The team will continue to research how contact works across Parliament and review archived research.

The team will also work on some of the issues highlighted in feedback received via the beta website. This will include reviewing:

* elements of the roles pages (primarily the timeline)
* information related to devolved administrations on members’ contact pages

##### Random things we have learned or have been reading

[Marttiina](https://twitter.com/marttiinak) has been reading a book, yet to be translated to English, called [‘Surrounded by Idiots: how to understand those cannot be understood’]( https://thomaserikson.com/en/books/) by the Swedish author, Thomas Erikson. It’s loosely based on [DISC model]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISC_assessment), which looks at different personality types and how they affect the way people communicate.

I read about [‘Frankenalgos’](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/29/coding-algorithms-frankenalgos-program-danger), [‘The Man Who Broke Ticketmaster’](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mgxqb8/the-man-who-broke-ticketmaster), [‘how to tell a good innovation story’](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/innovation-and-growth/telling-a-good-innovation-story), some articles about or by the architect and critic [Alexandra Lange](http://www.alexandralange.net/articles) and a [185-foot stacked log cabin tower in the wilderness](https://www.designboom.com/architecture/attorney-phillip-weidner-goose-creek-tower-log-cabin-tower-alaska-04-08-2016/)
